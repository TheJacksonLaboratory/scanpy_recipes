Visualize gene expression per cluster
    You can visualize the gene expression in a chosen cluster for one or multiple genes, under the "Explore" tab.
        There are 2 sections under the Explore tab:
            -Expression (1 gene | 1 cluster)
                Use Expession to visualize the expression of one gene in a chosen cluster.
                -After entering a gene of interest and selecting a cluster from the drop-down list, clicking "Run" will show a 3 panel visual output.
                    -Panel 1 has a 3D plot of the gene’s expression across all cells in the cluster of interest.
                    -Panel 2 has a 2D plot of the same gene’s expression across all cells in that cluster. Within Panel 2, you can also download a .csv file of the gene-cell expression matrix by clicking and dragging over a group of cells. click "Download Expression" at the top of panel 2 to start the download.
                    -Panel 3 has violin plots of the gene’s cluster-specific expression and includes a total cell count with that gene for each cluster.
            -Panel Plot (multiple genes |  1 cluster)
                Use Panel Plot to visualize the expression of multiple genes of interest in one cluster
